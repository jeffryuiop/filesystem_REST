prerequisite:
Ubuntu 22 LTS, Docker

for testing: please pip install pytest locust

features:
- basic docker file for easier setup
- checked if file exist before upload / update / delete
- checked if len(in) = len(out) after upload update
- check if local file path is a file 
    - will trigger exception if a folder
- will create intermidiary folders if needed for upload
- concurrency ok as long as not requesting the same file
- stream version got a check for free space -> the vanilla version should trigger exception if not enough

future work:
- security(?) -> depends on if this api will be for internal use or not.
- to extend to windows, there might be a need to modify the codes. some imports might not work.
- write better test to reduce locust test fail cases

test: -> Additional library for testing: [pytest, locust]
    - check if everything is working -> and see how many request a server can handle
    - concurrency -> test if 2 request edit same file.
    - big files -> up to 1GB binary file have been tested
